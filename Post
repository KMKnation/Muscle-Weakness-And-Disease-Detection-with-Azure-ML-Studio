Last 7 months, I had gone through many ups and downs. Every bits and seconds my life was slowly taking a turn.

It all begin with, I lost my pet.

My father was diagnosed with high diabetes and dog bite him in leg. Also at the same time my mother was detected with fibrosis + hypertension.

I was dealing with all these things normally, but in the end of November, my mom suffered from “sepsis”.

She fought with it like a fighter for 5 days with 3 consequent dialysis and then she finally said Good bye to me on 4th December and she died right in front of my eyes.

My whole world changed 360 from that day. I felt like I too died that day. For at least 2-3 weeks, I had no idea what to do.



I want to thank @poojan.shah for giving me time to get back to work. Thanking my buddies Shrujal & Sushant for being with me at that last crucial night.

And specially, I want to thank Pankti for being with me for every moment.



Hence, This is not just the other nanodegree which I passed, It is a one of those thing which my mom have the memory of me of doing it.



Dedicating my success and everything to you mom ♥️
